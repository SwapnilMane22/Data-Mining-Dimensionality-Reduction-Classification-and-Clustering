# Classification Study

## Overview

This project focuses on classification techniques using datasets obtained from the UCI data archive. The datasets include `adult.data`, `adult.test`, and `adult.names`. The dataset consists of 15 columns, where the first 14 columns represent attributes, and the last column represents the class label.

The main goals of this project are:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Implementation of a classification method.
3. Error rate evaluation and comparison with reported benchmarks.
4. Analysis of performance using down-sampled datasets.
5. Proposal of improvements to outperform classic classifiers.

## Datasets

- **adult.data** - Used as the training dataset.
- **adult.test** - Used as the evaluation dataset.
- **adult.names** - Provides metadata and benchmark error rates for well-known classifiers.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Cleaning

Clean the dataset to handle missing values. Propose and implement a method for data cleaning that applies to both `adult.data` and `adult.test` files.

### 2. Classification Method Implementation

- Implement a classification algorithm based on techniques learned from literature.
- Use `adult.data` as the training set and `adult.test` as the evaluation set.
- Calculate the classification error rate based on misclassified samples.
- Provide documented source code.

### 3. Error Rate Comparison and Analysis&#x20;

- Compare the classification error rate with benchmarks in `adult.names`.
- Analyze and explain the differences.
- Suggest improvements to address discrepancies.

### 4. Down-Sampling Analysis&#x20;

- Randomly down-sample the training dataset (`adult.data`) using sampling rates of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%.
- Train the classifier using the down-sampled datasets and evaluate performance on `adult.test`.
- Repeat the process five times for each sampling rate to compute the mean and deviation of the error rate.
- Analyze the results and trends based on different sampling rates.

### 5. Classifier Improvement Proposal

- Propose a method to improve classification performance beyond the benchmarks reported in `adult.names`.
- Train and evaluate the proposed solution using `adult.data` and `adult.test`.
