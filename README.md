# Data Mining: Dimensionality, Reduction Classification and Clustering

This repository contains the implementation of several techniques for image classification and clustering. The methods used include **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**, **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. The primary goal is to enhance data representation, improve classification accuracy, and optimize clustering outcomes.

## Techniques Implemented

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Applied for dimensionality reduction of image datasets to improve computational efficiency and feature representation.
- **DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)**: Used for reducing the dimensionality of images while retaining essential features, particularly in frequency domains.
- **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**: A neural network model applied for classification tasks, achieving a classification error rate of **23.56%**.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Optimized using the **elbow method** to determine the optimal value of K for improved clustering performance, with the best K value found to be **4**.
